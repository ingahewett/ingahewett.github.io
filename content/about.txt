I'm a professional hair and make-up artist based in Cape Town, South Africa. My background includes full training in costume, make-up and styling as well as somatology. I keep my skills updated attending workshops, seminars, and working with some of South Africa's finest make-up artists.

My experience in skin care keeps me focused on creating a flawless, glowing skin against which to subtly emphasise key features. The challenge of interpreting a chosen look and storyline creates an endless source of inspiration and satisfaction.
